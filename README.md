# Algox

This project is a collection of various algorithms and data structures implemented in different programming languages. These implementations are largely me translating pseudocode into actual code.

## Contributing
Contributions are accepted in the following areas:
  - Adding algorithm groups (e.g sorting)
  - Adding implementations in other languages
  - Improving existing implementations
  - Updating the documentation

**Note** If there exists implementation of the same algorithm in the standard library of a language, **dont** use it 😁

May the hacking begin...
